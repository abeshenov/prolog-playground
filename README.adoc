= Playing with Prolog

Just for fun, I am reading

- Leon Sterling, Ehud Shapiro, "The Art of Prolog".

**Prolog** (from french _"programmation en logique"_) is a logical programming language.

In this repo, I will collect some code samples, solutions to exercises, etc.

I am using link:https://www.swi-prolog.org/[SWI Prolog].
In Debian, it is available from the package
https://packages.debian.org/stable/interpreters/swi-prolog:[`swi-prolog`].

There are a couple of plugins for VS Code:
link:https://github.com/arthwang/vsc-prolog[`vsc-prolog`] and
link:https://github.com/rebornix/vscode-prolog[`vscode-prolog`].
